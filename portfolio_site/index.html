              I am Chioma Ezulike. I am currently a student on a scholarship with Stutern in collaboration with I4G. I am studying to become a web developer with speciality in mobile development. I have few weeks experience but hope to learn, practice and master in this new path.

            <h2>My Career So Far</h2>
            <p>
              I am an accountant who is seeking a new career path in tech. My journey as a new techie <br> started a few weeks ago with the help of Stutern and Ingressive4Good. It has been a very <br> tasking journey but very educating and exciting. The ability to create and complete litle <br> tasks by myself has been very fulfilling. With constant practice, determination and <br> consistant effort, the sky will be my stepping stone. I am really grateful to my tutors,<br> mentors, fellow students and teammates.
