      <h3>About My Favorite Food</h3>
      <p>
        My fabvorite meal is <strong>Coconut Rice</strong> a popular West-African
        dish <br />
        Coconut rice is one of the most popular foods in West Africa, although
        the ingredients <br />
        and methods of preparation vary from location to region, the dish is
        often made in a single <br />
        pot with long-grain rice, coconut milk, onions, spices, vegetables, and
        chicken stock.
      </p>
      <h5>Origin</h5>
      <p>
        The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that
        was ruled by the Wolof or <br />
        Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The
        Gambia and Mauritania, <br />
        where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish
        called thieboudienne, containing <br />
        rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables. <br />
        Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann <br>
        considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger <br>
        valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal <br>
        to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in "linguistic, historical or political patterns".

        <ul>
          <li>Wash the rice until the water is clear. I usually wash mine for about 4-5 times. This is very important in order to reduce the starch and avoid ending up with mushy rice. If your rice ends up mushy, you will not enjoy it, so this step is very crucial.</li>
          <li>Cut all veggies into cubes with kitchen knife and set aside.</li>
          <li>Wash the chicken or any other type of meat. Season and cook until tender. You can further fry, grill, or roast them.</li>
          <li>On a medium heat, heat up vegetable oil and add the onions to saut√©.</li>
          <li>Add the salt, ginger, garlic and the seasoning cubes.</li>
          <li>Add the chicken stock and the coconut milk, cover, and allow to boil for about 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Now, add the washed rice to the boiling chicken stock & coconut milk.</li>
          <li>Cover with foil paper and let it cook in less than medium heat (steam) until soft and well cooked.</li>
          <li>Check after about 30 minutes to see if it is well cooked. A little quantity of water can be added if need be.</li>
          <li>Add the sliced spring onions and cover to steam for another five minutes, then take it away from the heat</li>
          <li>In another deep pan, add vegetable oil and fry the veggies one after the other (carrots, green beans, prawns, gizzard, onions) and set them aside.</li>
          <li>In the same deep pan, add the veggies bit by bit and also add some cooked rice in bits and mix them together. Repeat this process until everything is well mixed.</li>
          <li>Cover and allow to simmer for about three minutes.</li>
          <li>Then your coconut rice is ready!</li>
          <li>Can you perceive the goodness already?</li>
          <li>Serve hot with any protein and cold drink of your choice.</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
