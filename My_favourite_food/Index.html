    <h3>About My Favorite Meal</h3>
    <p>
      My favourite meal is <strong>Coconut Rice</strong> a popular West-African
      dish. Coconut rice is one of the most popular <br />
      foods in West Africa, although the ingredients and methods of preparation
      vary from location to region, <br />
      the dish is often made in a single pot with long-grain rice, coconut milk,
      onions, spices, vegetables, and <br />
      chicken stock.
    </p>
    <h4>Origin</h4>
    <p>
      Coconut rice is typically prepared by soaking white rice in coconut milk
      or cooking it with coconut flakes. <br />
      Though coconut rice is found in many cultures of the world, it is believed
      to have its origins in the South <br />
      Asia, Southeast Asia and Latin America regions. It is a rice dish that is
      used in cuisines such as Caribbean, <br />
      Tropical (Hawaiian!) as well as South East Asian foods such as Thai and
      Malaysian foods. There is no clear <br />
      history of its origin. But, it can be said that this recipe comes from the
      culinary mixtures of African.

    <h3>Steps to prepare the meal</h3>
    <ul>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        Wash the rice until the water is clear. I usually wash mine for about
        4-5 times. This is very important in order to <br />
        reduce the starch and avoid ending up with mushy rice. If your rice ends
        up mushy, you will not enjoy it, so this <br />
        step is very crucial.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>Cut all veggies into cubes with kitchen knife and set aside.</li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        Wash the chicken or any other type of meat. Season and cook until
        tender. You can further fry, grill, or roast them.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        On a medium heat, heat up vegetable oil and add the onions to saut√©.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>Add the salt, ginger, garlic and the seasoning cubes.</li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        Add the chicken stock and the coconut milk, cover, and allow to boil for
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        Now, add the washed rice to the boiling chicken stock & coconut milk.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        Cover with foil paper and let it cook in less than medium heat (steam)
        until soft and well cooked.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        Check after about 30 minutes to see if it is well cooked. A little
        quantity of water can be added if need be.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        Add the sliced spring onions and cover to steam for another five
        minutes, then take it away from the heat
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        In another deep pan, add vegetable oil and fry the veggies one after the
        other (carrots, green beans, prawns, gizzard, <br />
        onions) and set them aside.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>
        In the same deep pan, add the veggies bit by bit and also add some
        cooked rice in bits and mix them together. <br />
        Repeat this process until everything is well mixed.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>Cover and allow to simmer for about three minutes.</li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>Then your coconut rice is ready!</li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>Can you perceive the goodness already?</li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>Serve hot with any protein and cold drink of your choice.</li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
