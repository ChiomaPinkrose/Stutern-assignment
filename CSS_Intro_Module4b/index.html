                curently pursuing a new career path in tech. I am only a few
                months old into this journey and it has been a very intersting
                and fun journey. I have had some ups and downs but I'm happy to
                be doing this. I ventured in because of my love for technology -
                its diversity, ever changing, countinous learning, updating and
                upgrading. I hope to use my knowledge to impact positively.</i

                >The margin is the space around an element's border. It controls
                the space outside an element. Padding is the space between an
                element's border and the element's content. It controls the
                space inside the element. The CSS border on the other hand is
                used to seperate or draw attention to a content. It goes around
                the padding and the content.
